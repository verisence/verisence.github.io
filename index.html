      <h1>About</h1>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>I am a university student, in my final year, and I have always had an interest in programming since joining my first year and being introduced to it. Up to this point most of my programming knowledge and experience has been self-taught with the knowledge from class being an introduction of concepts and the theoretical part.</p>
      <p>The reason I decided to take this programming class was to improve my web development skills and expand on the knowledge already gained from university through a practical approach. Another reason is to learn how to relate and collaborate with other developers as we learn in a <span class="bold">market driven</span> environment.</p>
      <h2>Interests and Hobbies</h2>
